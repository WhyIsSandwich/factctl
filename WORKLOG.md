## Project Overview
factctl is a runtime orchestrator for Factorio game instances, managing mods, runtimes, and server configurations.

## Current Status
- [x] Source Resolution System (Complete)
- [x] Authentication System (Complete)
- [x] JSONC Parser (Complete)
- [x] Instance Management System (Complete)
- [x] Mod Management System (Complete)
- [x] Runtime Management System (Complete)
- [x] CLI Implementation (Complete)
- [x] Documentation (Complete)

## First Pass Status: âœ… COMPLETE

The first pass implementation is now complete with all core functionality working:

### âœ… Completed Features
- **CLI Implementation**: Full command-line interface with all commands
- **Instance Management**: Create, update, remove instances with validation
- **Mod Management**: Download and install mods from multiple sources
- **Runtime Management**: Factorio version management and execution
- **Log Management**: Real-time log streaming and historical access
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and user guidance
- **Progress Reporting**: Visual progress indicators for operations
- **Documentation**: Complete README, quick start guide, and examples

### ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Use
The tool is now functional for basic Factorio instance management. Users can:
- Create and manage Factorio instances
- Install mods from Portal, GitHub, and Git sources
- Run instances with proper configuration
- Monitor logs in real-time
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
